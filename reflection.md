Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

BLUHHHH I don't know what happened with the fly() map stuff. I will ask tomorrow. or i guess today because I'm over the deadline AGAIN. I swear I'm trying.
Anyway I made a wizard like I said i would. Undo() was very intimidating, but it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. I thought it would be really bad, though, so that's not saying that much. I did implement additional mmethods, mostly ones that allowed more information gathering, like look() and checkInventory(). Oh also I made Two Extra Classes. whyy. I didn't want little Pesto wandering around in an empty void and now they can only pick up things that are actually there. Uh. Also "Pesto" was a typo i originally was going to call the wizard "Presto" but I mstyped once and ten decided to keep it. I'm not sure if i have any advice that i haven't already said in previous reflections.
